# A collection of Tools and Techniques to Inspect Binary/Executable/Object files

The repository contains descriptions/READMEs and tools which can be used to effectively peek into an object file or a binary to analyze it's contents. Extremely useful in understanding how the compiler driver embeds device object into host binaries(GPGPU). Currently has some linking related stuff.

Expect me to put more notes and learnings as it goes.
